class WarningsFilter():
    '''
    Context manager to implement a policy whereby a Conway-based application should never issue warnings,
    and alerts the user if any such warning corresponds to a user error.

    The motivation for this policy is prevent sloppy behavior by developers whereby they allow their application
    to emit a lot of spurious warnings and never clean them up.

    To prevent that, the WarningsFilter context manager requires that developers explicity declare the kind
    of warnings that are benign. Any other type of warning is treated as an error and for that reason this
    WarningsFilter would raise either a RuntimeError or a ValueError, depending on whether the fault
    lies with the Conway application codebase (i.e., a "bug" or malfunction, hence a RuntimeError)
    or with the user (a ValueError).

    A typical example of a benign warning is a DeprecationWarning in a 3rd party library. Such warning is
    intended for the developers of the 3rd party library, not the developers of a Conway-based application. 
    Therefore, Conway application developers can register such benign warnings with this WarningsFilter
    so that they are suppressed. That stops the Conway-based application from logging spurious messages.

    A second use case for this context manager
    is that some warnings from 3rd-party libraries are really the result of user errors.
    In those cases we want to guide the user for how to correct the error. First of all, we want to make 
    the user aware that an error happened in the first place: i.e., the warning should be turned into an
    exception, not just a message lost in a big log that nobody looks at. 
    Second, we want to provide a user-friendly message in terms of the domain model of the
    Conway application that the user understands, not the obstruse inner workings of a 3rd-party library
    used within the Conway application

    To address the above use cases, this context manager will accumulate warnings silently during its processing.
    Then upon exiting the WarningsFilter will look at the warnings. If any is for a user error, it will
    raise a ValueError for the first such warning it encounters.

    If no warning is a user error, but if there are warnings that were not previously registered as benign,
    then this WarningsFilter will collect them into a single message and raise a RuntimeError. This RuntimeError
    is intended to notify the Conway application developer that they probably have a "bug". This might
    be as simple as needing to register additional benign warnings, or 
    possibly fix something more serious in the code.

    To assist the Conway application developer in this task, the RuntimeError raised by this WarningsFilter
    will include information for each non-benign warning, including the stack trace in the Conway application
    that led to the warning.

        Helper method for this class to handle certain warnings that a Conway application considers user errors, as
        opposed to development-type errors.

        Normally 3rd-party warnings should be pre-empted at development time by the Conway application developers
        using those 3rd party dependencies correctly, avoiding code constructs that the 3rd party flags as
        risky or deprecated.

        However, in some cases the warning from the 3rd party library is really a user error, so the

        In those cases, we want to assist the user with useful information about how to correct the error.
        It is often not a good idea to just cascade the warning message to the user "as is", since
        the warning typically has jargon related to the 3rd party
        library that the user knows nothing about. So to improve usability, this method allows Conway application
        developers to convert such obstruse warnings into a ValueError whose message is expressed in terms of
        the Conway application domain model, which is what the user can understand. The ValueErorr is raised
