        This method creates a copy of this DataHub content and saves it to a folder whose name is given by the
        `snapshot_name` parameter. 

        A main use case for this notion of "snapshot" is the test harness: some tests need to exercise the business
        logic over multiple time periods, and in the process may want to save a copy of what a DataHub's content
        is at various points along the way. 

        Here is an example for such a use case, identified as scenario 1001. Suppose this method is called on an 
        DataHub object representing content under a root like

            ".../vulnerability_management_scenarios/1001/ACTUALS@latest/publications"

        In our use case, the test case might want to do multiple snapshots that can be thought of as "ACTUALS@T1", "ACTUALS@T2", 
        "ACTUALS@T3", etc. for what the database looked at various points in the test's dataflow, such as at times T1, T2, T3, ... 

        The parameter `snapshot_root_folder` should be given in accordance with that intention. For example, if the intention
        is to snapshot data as of time T2, the natural value for the `snapshot_root_folder` parameter would be 

            ".../vulnerability_management_scenarios/1001/ACTUALS@T2/publications"
